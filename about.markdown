I worked as a DevOps Engineer and Penetration Tester in a product based company.

Hands-on experience on AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud. I use a considerable part of my spare time to participate in bug bounties and perform freelance security research.

Moreover, I am a self-learner and passionate about Cybersecurity.

Recently, I am trying to get more skilled in binary analysis/exploitation and reverse engineering.
